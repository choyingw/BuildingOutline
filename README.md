In this repo, we provide some samples from Google Maps and their generated mask. We use training data of ADE20K (https://github.com/CSAILVision/sceneparsing) to train networks of semantic segmentation. Also some pretrained models are available here (https://github.com/CSAILVision/sceneparsing)

Please run the main.m for demo.
